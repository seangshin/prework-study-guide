          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet since developers keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>The CSS box model states that every HTML element is essentially a box which consists of margins ouside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
